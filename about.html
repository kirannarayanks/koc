            <h3>About Us<hr></h3>
            <p>Vaishya Youth Association , Kochi is a youth organisation which was founded in 1968 for
             building the enthusiastic, cultured, socialistic youth from and for the konkani speaking
             vaishya community as well as for the society. In 2018 the organisation celebrated it’s 
             golden jubilee in the divine presence of vaishya guru SRI SRI VAMANASRAM SWAMIJI.</p>

             <p>The Vaishya Youth Association Kochi was the first organisation which was formed for our
             community in kerala. In 1971 T G Rathnakar , trustee of Sreemadh janardhana Devaswam allotted 
             the building located in the althara bagavathy temple compound for the Association ,thus the 
             first office was started in that building . in 1970 ‘s there was no facilities or encouragement
              for the students in the community for their studies. At that time VYA encouraged students by 
              giving cash awards for the students who passed SSLC. In 1974 membership was given for all 
              youth in the community who were of age 18. At that time the committee was focused mainly 
              on the uplift of the students in their education as well as their passion. The fund scholarships
               were raised by conducting film fest and drama fest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1985 the bylaw was created which filtered the member age to 18-35 . For the uplift of the
                    youth with certain passion and interest in the arts and sports association started an annual
                    arts and sports meet which was conducted from Vijayadhashami to Diwali. By the 3rd decade 
                    of youth’s history the office was changed to the building in the compound of Sree janardhana
                    temple as a part of the old building renovation .But after the renovation the building in 
                    althara bagavathy temple compound was’nt allowed for the association.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the alumni program conducted by Golden jubilee committee which had delegates from 
                    Sree Janardhana Devaswom , Alumni members requested for the reallocation of the office 
                    in the very first location. Thus the Golden jubilee committee decided to build the first
                    floor for the office as a Golden Jubilee memorial with the permission of the trustees.
